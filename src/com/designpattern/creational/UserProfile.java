/*
The Builder Pattern is particularly useful when creating objects with many optional parameters,
complex configurations, or readability concerns.

Example Without Builder Pattern: The Problem
Suppose we have a Car class that has multiple optional features like color, engineType, sunroof, and automaticTransmission.
Without the Builder Pattern, we typically use constructor overloading or setter methods, both of which lead to problems:

If your object has only 2-3 parameters, a simple constructor is fine. But if you have 5+ parameters (especially optional ones), the Builder Pattern is the best choice! ðŸŽ¯

Would you like another example with a different use case? ðŸ˜Š
