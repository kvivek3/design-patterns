The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also provides support for undoable operations. This pattern decouples the objects that produce commands from the objects that execute them.

### Naive Approach

In a naive approach, you might have direct method calls to execute specific actions. For example, consider a remote control system for a home automation setup. You might have methods like `turnOnLight()`, `turnOffLight()`, `increaseTemperature()`, etc., directly called based on user actions. This approach leads to:

1. **Tight Coupling**: The invoker is tightly coupled with the action implementation, making it hard to change or extend.
2. **Lack of Flexibility**: Adding new commands or altering existing ones requires changing the invoker logic.
3. **No Support for Undo/Redo**: It is challenging to implement undo/redo functionalities as actions are executed immediately.

### Command Pattern Solution

The Command Pattern addresses these issues by introducing a command interface with an `execute()` method. Each concrete command class implements this interface and encapsulates a request by binding together a set of actions on a specific receiver.

#### Real-World Scenario: Remote Control System

- **Problem**: You want a flexible remote control that can support various devices and actions like turning on/off devices, adjusting settings, etc., with the ability to add new commands easily and support undo operations.

- **Solution**: Use the Command Pattern to encapsulate each action as a command object.

### Implementation in Java

1. **Command Interface**: Defines the `execute()` method.

```java
interface Command {
    void execute();
    void undo(); // Optional for undo functionality
}
```

2. **Concrete Commands**: Implement the `Command` interface and define specific actions.

```java
class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public LightOnCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    public void execute() {
        light.turnOn();
    }

    public void undo() {
        light.turnOff();
    }
}

class LightOffCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public LightOffCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    public void execute() {
        light.turnOff();
    }

    public void undo() {
        light.turnOn();
    }
}
```

3. **Receiver**: The class that knows how to perform the work needed to carry out the request.

```java
class Light {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("The light is on");
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("The light is off");
    }
}
```

4. **Invoker**: Holds a command and at some point asks the command to carry out a request.

```java
class RemoteControl {
    private Command command;

    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void pressButton() {
        command.execute();
    }
    
    public void pressUndo() {
        command.undo();
    }
}
```

5. **Client**: Configures the receiver and its commands.

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Light livingRoomLight = new Light();
        Command lightOn = new LightOnCommand(livingRoomLight);
        Command lightOff = new LightOffCommand(livingRoomLight);
        
        RemoteControl remote = new RemoteControl();
        
        remote.setCommand(lightOn);
        remote.pressButton(); // The light is on
        
        remote.setCommand(lightOff);
        remote.pressButton(); // The light is off
        
        remote.pressUndo(); // The light is on (undo last action)
    }
}
```

### Benefits of the Command Pattern

- **Decoupling**: The invoker is decoupled from the concrete commands and the receiver, allowing flexibility and ease of maintenance.
- **Extensibility**: New commands can be added without altering existing code.
- **Undo/Redo**: Supports implementing undo/redo functionality by tracking command history.
- **Queuing and Logging**: Commands can be logged, queued, and executed at a later time.

### Notes

- **Undo/Redo**: Ensure each command can revert its action to support undo functionality.
- **Variations**: The pattern can be extended to include more sophisticated features like command queues and macro commands (composing multiple commands).
