The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that facilitates communication between different objects in a system by introducing a mediator object. This pattern helps reduce the complexity of communication between objects by centralizing the interactions, thus promoting loose coupling.

### Naive Approach:
In a system without the Mediator Pattern, each object communicates directly with other objects. This direct communication leads to a tightly coupled system where objects are dependent on each other's implementations. As the number of objects increases, the complexity grows exponentially, making the system difficult to maintain and extend.

#### Example of Naive Approach:
Consider a chat application where multiple users (objects) can send messages to each other. Without a mediator, each user would need to know about all other users and directly send messages to them. This results in a lot of dependencies among user objects.

### Mediator Pattern Solution:
The Mediator Pattern introduces a mediator object that handles all communications between the different objects. Instead of directly interacting with each other, objects communicate through the mediator. This reduces the dependencies among objects, making the system easier to maintain and extend.

#### Mediator Pattern Example:
In the same chat application, we introduce a `ChatRoom` mediator that handles all message exchanges. Users send messages to the `ChatRoom`, which then forwards the messages to the appropriate recipients. Users are no longer aware of each other's presence, only the mediator knows all users.

### Java Implementation:

#### Naive Approach Example:
```java
class User {
    private String name;
    
    public User(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public void sendMessage(String message, User toUser) {
        System.out.println(this.name + " sends message to " + toUser.getName() + ": " + message);
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

public class ChatApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        User user1 = new User("Alice");
        User user2 = new User("Bob");
        
        user1.sendMessage("Hello, Bob!", user2);
        user2.sendMessage("Hi, Alice!", user1);
    }
}
```

#### Mediator Pattern Example:
```java
interface ChatMediator {
    void showMessage(User user, String message);
}

class ChatRoom implements ChatMediator {
    @Override
    public void showMessage(User user, String message) {
        System.out.println(user.getName() + ": " + message);
    }
}

class User {
    private String name;
    private ChatMediator mediator;
    
    public User(String name, ChatMediator mediator) {
        this.name = name;
        this.mediator = mediator;
    }
    
    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        mediator.showMessage(this, message);
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

public class MediatorPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ChatMediator chatRoom = new ChatRoom();
        
        User user1 = new User("Alice", chatRoom);
        User user2 = new User("Bob", chatRoom);
        
        user1.sendMessage("Hello, Bob!");
        user2.sendMessage("Hi, Alice!");
    }
}
```

### Benefits of the Mediator Pattern:
- **Reduced Complexity**: Objects do not need to reference each other directly, reducing the complexity of interactions.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to manage and extend the system as the number of objects increases.
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Changes can be made to the communication process without affecting the individual objects.

### Notes:
- The mediator pattern is particularly useful in systems with many interacting objects.
- The mediator can become a complex object itself if it handles too many responsibilities, so it's essential to ensure that it doesn't become a bottleneck.
