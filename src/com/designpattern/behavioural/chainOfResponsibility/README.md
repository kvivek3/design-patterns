The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled or the end of the chain is reached. This pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receivers, giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request.

### Naive Approach:

In a naive approach, you might handle different types of requests using a single class with multiple conditional statements (e.g., `if-else` or `switch`). This can lead to:

- **Complex and Rigid Code**: The handling logic becomes tightly coupled and difficult to maintain.
- **Scalability Issues**: Adding new types of requests requires modifying existing code, which can introduce bugs.

**Example Problem:**

Consider a support ticket system where requests need to be handled by different levels of support (e.g., Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 support). Using the naive approach, a single class would contain all logic to decide which support level should handle a request.

### Chain of Responsibility Pattern Solution:

The Chain of Responsibility Pattern addresses these issues by:

- **Decoupling**: Separating request handling logic into different handler classes.
- **Flexibility**: Allowing handlers to be easily added, removed, or reordered in the chain.

**Example Solution:**

In the support ticket system, each support level can be represented as a handler in the chain. A request is passed from one handler to the next until it is handled.

### Java Implementation:

**Handler Interface:**

```java
abstract class SupportHandler {
    protected SupportHandler nextHandler;

    public void setNextHandler(SupportHandler handler) {
        this.nextHandler = handler;
    }

    public abstract void handleRequest(String request);
}
```

**Concrete Handlers:**

```java
class LevelOneSupport extends SupportHandler {
    @Override
    public void handleRequest(String request) {
        if (request.equals("Basic")) {
            System.out.println("Level One Support: Handling basic request.");
        } else if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handleRequest(request);
        }
    }
}

class LevelTwoSupport extends SupportHandler {
    @Override
    public void handleRequest(String request) {
        if (request.equals("Intermediate")) {
            System.out.println("Level Two Support: Handling intermediate request.");
        } else if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handleRequest(request);
        }
    }
}

class LevelThreeSupport extends SupportHandler {
    @Override
    public void handleRequest(String request) {
        if (request.equals("Advanced")) {
            System.out.println("Level Three Support: Handling advanced request.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Request not handled.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Client Code:**

```java
public class ChainOfResponsibilityTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SupportHandler levelOne = new LevelOneSupport();
        SupportHandler levelTwo = new LevelTwoSupport();
        SupportHandler levelThree = new LevelThreeSupport();

        levelOne.setNextHandler(levelTwo);
        levelTwo.setNextHandler(levelThree);

        // Start handling requests
        levelOne.handleRequest("Basic");
        levelOne.handleRequest("Intermediate");
        levelOne.handleRequest("Advanced");
        levelOne.handleRequest("Unknown");
    }
}
```

### Summary:

- **Naive Approach**: Handling logic is centralized, making it difficult to manage and extend.
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: Each handler in the chain deals with specific request types, allowing for more manageable and extendable code.

This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple objects can handle a request, and the exact handler is determined at runtime. It provides an elegant way to handle complex request processing logic without cluttering code with conditionals.
